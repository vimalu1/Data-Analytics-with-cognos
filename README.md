# Data-Analytics-with-cognos

**Objective:**
The primary objective of this project is to conduct an in-depth analysis of unemployment in Tamil Nadu, focusing on its detrimental effects on poverty, starvation, and the state's economy, specifically its contribution to the decline in the GDP of the Indian state.

**Analysis Approach:**

1. **Data Integration:**
   - We have merged historical and current datasets on unemployment to create a comprehensive analysis. The integrated data allows us to identify trends and patterns over time.

2. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - We have compared the unemployment data in Tamil Nadu with data from other regions or countries to gain broader insights into the situation, enabling us to understand how Tamil Nadu's unemployment situation compares to other areas.

3. **Trend Exploration:**
   - We have identified and explored trends in unemployment rates over time to understand fluctuations and potential causes, enabling us to make informed recommendations and policy suggestions.

**Visualization Types:**

1. **Bar Chart:**
   - We have utilized bar charts to display categories of joblessness on the x-axis against the count or percentage of unemployed individuals on the y-axis. Different types of unemployment are differentiated with distinct colors for easy comparison.

2. **Pie Chart:**
   - We have used pie charts to display the proportionate distribution of various unemployment types, assigning each category a slice in the pie chart to provide a clear visual representation of the distribution.

3. **Stacked Bar Chart:**
   - We have visualized the composition of unemployment types as sections of a bar, enabling comparisons across different periods or regions. Stacked bar charts provide a visual breakdown of the components contributing to overall unemployment.

4. **Treemap:**
   - We have employed treemaps to display the relative proportions of different unemployment categories using nested rectangles within a larger rectangle. Treemaps offer a hierarchical view of data, making it easy to understand the proportions of various categories within the whole.

**Insights on Demographic Characteristics of Marginal Workers:**

1. **Age Distribution:**
   - We have determined if unemployment is prevalent among different demographic groups, including younger, middle-aged, and older individuals, providing insights into age-related unemployment trends.

2. **Gender Disparities:**
   - We have analyzed gender disparities within joblessness, exploring the roles, job types, or income levels that contribute to these disparities.

3. **Educational Achievement:**
   - We have assessed the educational levels of the unemployed to understand the link between education and employment status, which can guide educational and skill development policies.

4. **Rural vs. Urban Disparities:**
   - We have investigated if unemployment is more prominent in rural or urban areas, providing insights for regional development strategies and targeted interventions.

5. **Caste and Ethnicity:**
   - We have explored whether certain castes or ethnic groups are disproportionately represented among the unemployed, which can inform targeted interventions and policies to address disparities.

6. **Conjugal Status and Family Composition:**
   - We have examined the family responsibilities and care duties among the unemployed, identifying needs for support systems, including childcare and family support.

7. **Geographic Distribution:**
   - We have mapped areas with high concentrations of unemployed individuals to inform targeted interventions and regional development strategies.

8. **Movement Patterns:**
   - We have analyzed if the unemployed move frequently or permanently for work, helping plan appropriate support systems for these mobile workers and address the challenges they face.

This comprehensive analysis and the insights obtained will be valuable for policymakers, researchers, and organizations working to address unemployment issues in Tamil Nadu and beyond. The visualizations and demographic insights will help inform evidence-based policy decisions and targeted interventions.
